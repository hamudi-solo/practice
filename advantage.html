    <h2><u>Advantages / Life Lessons from Abdullahi's Story</u></h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Skill is Power</li>
    <p>Even without money, having a skill (like shoemaking) can help you survive and succeed.</p>
    <li>Responsibility at a Young Age</li>
    <p>Abdullahi took care of his family at only 12 — proving that maturity doesn’t come with age but with action.</p>
    <li>Education Changes Everything</li>
    <p>One opportunity for education transformed his life and gave him the tools to build his future.</p>
    <li>Hard Work Builds Respect</li>
    <p>The man helped Abdullahi because he saw his dedication — hard work attracts people who want to help</p>
    <li>From Struggles Come Strength</li>
    <p>His difficult past made him strong, humble, and grateful. Pain taught him patience.</p>
    <li>Giving Back to the Community</li>
    <p>Abdullahi didn’t forget his roots — he opened a school to lift others just like he was lifted.</p>
    <li>Business Can Start Small</li>
    <p>He started with just a needle and glue, but turned it into a real business — no need to wait for “perfect conditions.”</p>
    <li>Reuse and Innovate</li>
    <p>His idea of making shoes from recycled tires shows how creativity and problem-solving can create opportunity.</p>
    <li>Growth Takes Time</li>
    <p>It took years of learning, failing, and working before he became successful — patience is key.</p>
    <li>Stay Humble, Stay Focused</li>
    <p>Even after success, Abdullahi remained connected to his beginnings — true success is remembering who you are.</p>
